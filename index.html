        <h1>Police</h1>
        <h2>by: Gabriel Cabalza</h2>
    </header>
    <p>As a future policeman, my duty is not only focused on catching big criminals or stopping them. I also must help address as many topics as possible, including bullying. While it may seem that my profession is far from addressing bullying, it isnâ€™t. Helping people is my goal, and lending a hand can lead to social change. Please trust me when I say that we are capable of creating social change.</p>
